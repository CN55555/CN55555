ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yaxin Zheng!

- Iâ€™ll be updating my notes from reading the top finance journals from the past five years. 

- Sharing these notes helps others discover great papers and saves time for fellow finance enthusiasts.

- Additionally, Iâ€™ll be posting coding files that replicate results from these top journals, providing valuable learning resources.

Letâ€™s enjoy this journey together!âœ¨
